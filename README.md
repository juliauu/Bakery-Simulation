# ðŸ¥– Bakery Simulation
This project simulates a bakery production system using multithreading in C++.
- **Millers** supply ingredients (flour and water).
- **Bakers** use the ingredients to bake bread.
- **Bakery Clock** manages the day/night cycle, controlling production times.
## How it works:
- Press 'p' to add a miller.
- Press 'c' to add a baker.
- Press 'q' to stop the simulation.
